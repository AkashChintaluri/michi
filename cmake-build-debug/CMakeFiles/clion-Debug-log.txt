CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/PCLConfig.cmake:146 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable EIGEN_ROOT is set to:

    /usr/include/eigen3

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrealsense2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "realsense2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "realsense2" with
  any of the following names:

    realsense2Config.cmake
    realsense2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "realsense2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "realsense2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "realsense2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
